      <p>Thank you for requesting our new catalogue. We aim to keep your Triumph on the road at the most competitive price. Having said that, we DO NOT sell cheap inferior parts. We work on the principle that we will not sell you a part that we would not be happy to use in our own workshops. However, due to the fact that you are running an older car, it is sometimes not possible to obtain the correct part and we may have to supply an alternative to keep you on the road. We can always give current advice on such matters – please ask.</p>
      <p>We will try harder than anyone else to give you the best service. If you can’t find it then please ask! We are here to help. Finally if you do have a complaint (and every company gets them) please ask for Gary Bates – the buck stops there! He is not always available as he is often out on the road, but your complaint will be dealt with and taken seriously, after all we want you to come back! </p>
